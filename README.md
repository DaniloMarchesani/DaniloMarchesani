## :technologist: About me
I'm a full-stack developer, where I mostly worked on projects based on the React framework and NodeJs projects.
I started my journey 3 years ago by attending a training course where I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of:
- OOP 
- design patterns
- HTML / CSS 3
- TailwindCss
- Javascript / Typescript
- React JS 
- Node JS / Express
- Java 17 
- Spring Boot 
- Relational Databases
After which I had an experience at an IT company where I worked in a team in which I collaborated on the development and putting into production of an internal application built on React framework and bug fixing of the old application which was based on HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
In addition to technical skills, I have developed excellent problem solving and team working skills and on my own I have studied various technologies regarding frontend development by myself like styled compoments, State managements systems and SSR development with NextJs.
I also had the opportunity to have experience in a company in Ireland where I was able to participate in an international team and collaborated on the development of a marketplace app for a partner company and it was mainly on React technology.
